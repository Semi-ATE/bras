WHAT IS bras?

Bras is intended to do roughly the same job as the (in)famous
`make'-utitlity. It executes commands according to a set of rules.

Although I am quite happy with `make' most of the time, it has some
rough edges which I really dislike. Therefore I decided the other day
that I want to have my own little tool without the rough edges. The
result is bras.

Main features are:
o rule-controlled command execution, similar to make;
o written in Tcl, no compilation required;
o Tcl-syntax so that commands associated with rules may contain
  control structures;
o dependencies in foreign directories can trigger sourcing rule files
  in that directory, recursive bras-execution is not necessary;
o just any boolean expression can describe, when a target is out-of-date
o pattern rules which deserve the name;
o reasoning engine can also be used within Tk-applications
