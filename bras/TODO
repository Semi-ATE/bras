Kill >@stdin and the like from -ve output.

also requested by Tom Holroyd <tomh@po.crl.go.jp>.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
2001-09-30:

add a path to search to [include]. Toying around with this idea for
quite some time, but now also Tom Holroyd <tomh@po.crl.go.jp> asked
for it. 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
2001-09-30:

.brasrc to put e.g. ::bras::configure -ve 1 into it

Proposed by Tom Holroyd <tomh@po.crl.go.jp>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
2001-09-30:

Globbing for targets such that we can write things like

  Make libs {[updated [globtarget lib*]]}
  Make pack {[updated [globtarget pack-*]]} 

where [globtargets] looks into the list of targets rather than the
file system.

In `make', targets are just files, in `bras' targets are just `names', 
consequently [globtarget] would fit in quite well.

proposed by: max@malva.com.ua

2001-09-30: DISMISSED

predicate [follow] like this

> proc follow args {
>         ::bras::consider $args
>         return 0
> }

Note that neither trigger nor deps is set.
Proposed by Tom Holroyd <tomh@po.crl.go.jp>

==> Like [true] (aka Always) this breaks
the chain of reasoning which I consider a Bad Thing. Instead,
[updated] should be used.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
2001-09-30:

Add predicate [exists] with glob-facilities. Comes in handy for target 
clean when the existing files are entered into trigger. Might also be
useful for .tex-compilation to depend on the existence on an .aux-file.

Proposed by Tom Holroyd <tomh@po.crl.go.jp>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
2000-05-25: DONE

Add predicate varChanged as proposed in Mail to Nils from 2000-03-15.

Add function forget.

Make -ve reversible in configure.

Allow output destination to be configured such that it is easy to be
redirected into a widget.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
2000-03-15:

Write a bunch of small dedicated real world examples.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1999-06-03: DONE

Why prerequisites? If the reasoning process can be called explicitely
anytime, instead of

   Newer bla.o {bla.c // hinzel kunzel jockel} {
     just do it
   }

one can to

   Newer bla.o bla.c {
     consider [list hinzel kunzel jockel]
     just do it
   }
   
I'll probably remove the prerequisites stuff very soon.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1999-01-01:

o Find out how to give every brasfile its own scope so that a variable
  like SRC is not messed up, if it is used in several brasfiles.



++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1999-01-01:

o Parallel execution (like make's -j)



++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1999-01-01: DONE, only (b) survived

o Option to switch between the following modes:
  a) Collect *all* commands first, then start executing
  b) Start executing as soon as a command shows up. 
     - Might be complicated in connection with targets which cannot be
     made with their first rule.   
     - Might conflict with option -d



++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1999-01-01:
o A check to test if there is a rule for a target.



++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1999-01-01:

o Catch all-rules as pattern-rules
>- This doesn't work either:
>PatternNewer (.*\.a} {} {echo a}
>
>The idea would be a match anything rule for building libraries.. 



++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1999-01-01:

o Selective rule dumping for debugging purposes.



++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1999-01-01:

o Allow the directories of @-dependencies to be mapped through one
stage of indirection, so that @bla/ri/lu does not lead to bla/ri, but
to $DIRMAP(bla/ri) or the like.

--> Why? 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1999-01-01:
o Suggestion from jgg@debian.org

Ack, and a final thing. It would be nice to be able to assign dependancies
to PatternRules, ie:

PatternCDepends {\.deps/.*\.d$} .cc {// .deps} {

So that .deps will be added to the prereq list.

--> Obsolete since 0.99.0

------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is done already (read from bottom to top):
===============================================
o More intelligent abseiling along a chain of pattern rule so that
there is no need for intermediate targets to exist. (See more todos
about pattern rules below)
(Done, 1997-11-17)


o Suggestion from jgg@debian.org. A better way to use pattern rules.

Newer ../objs/t.o ../t.cc
PatternNet {.*\.o} .cc {...}

Will do this. when considering t.o
  1) t.o has no command list, attempt to generate one with the pattern
     rules
  2) To do this is calles a new function Match.cc over all depends
  3) by default Match.cc is a regx match of ".*\.cc" but can be user
     overriden
  4) If that finds a match then use that rule
  5) If no match is found then switch to 'trying to find a match in the
     file system' which is that same as if the Newer line didn't exist
  6) Call Dep.cc to generate a filesystem name for the .cc file, see if it 
     exists, if so use this rule.
(Done, 1997-11-17. The function is called GenMatch. It does not look
into the file system. If looking for a default command, there is
already a rule, i.e there is a (probably empty) dependency list, so
there is no need to consult the file system.)


o Make -n really *DO NOTHING*. Move the current behaviour of -n to an
option with another name.
(Done, 1997-11-16, using -N for the old behaviour)

o Silent operation, very silent operation.
(Done, 1997-11-16, using -s and -ss)

o Do I have the same problem for pattern rules?
(Yes, corrected 1997-11-09)


o BUG: defaultCmd considers pattern rules in the order in which they
were entered. This way it is not possible to override a "standard"
pattern rule with you own one. (Check doc regarding this.)
(Corrected 1997-11-08).

o BUG: SuffixNewer is mentioned in the html-files. (Should be
Pattern...)
(Corrected 1997-11-08).
