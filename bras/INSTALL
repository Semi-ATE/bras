PREREQUISITES

If you don't have tcl, you are out of luck. You need a Tcl version
with namespace support, i.e. >= 8.0 .

INSTALLATION

Run the commands (*)

  tclsh bras prefix=/directory/where/to/install
  tclsh bras install prefix=/directory/where/to/install

to install bras. This will install bras' files in the following
directories: 

   $prefix/bin
   $prefix/lib/bras-$VERSION
   $prefix/doc/bras-$VERSION
   $prefix/man/man1

Read the top of `brasfile' to see how to individually change these
directories. 

				That easy?
					I hope so!

------
(*) You may as well just run the 2nd command. The two of them are
necessary if the prefix must be different for the two commands, like
when building a package or using stow (see
http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/stow.html)
