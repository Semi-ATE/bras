		     Rule Based Command Execution

I am pleased to announce version 2.3.

WHAT'S NEW?

Handling of rules with multiple targets now always assumes that
the rule's predicate tests all of the targets in parallel. Previously
this was only assumed when one of the rule's targets was out-of-date.

Pattern rules for C++.

Some support to compile Java source. See example in the distribution
as well as keyword "Java" in the doc's index.


WHERE CAN I GET IT?

The distribution  can be found at

WHAT IS IT ANYWAY?

Bras is a rules-based command execution system, ala 'make'. It
includes a powerful rules system supporting foreign directory
triggers, multiple rule types, and on-the-fly dependency
generation. It is written in Tcl and uses Tcl as its script language.

Main features are:
o rule-controlled command execution, similar to make;
o written in Tcl, no compilation required;
o Tcl-syntax so that commands associated with rules may contain
  control structures;
o dependencies in foreign directories can trigger sourcing rule files
  in that directory, recursive bras-execution is not necessary;
o just any boolean expression can be used to define when a target is
  out-of-date;
o pattern rules which allow to derive dependencies and/or commands on
  the fly;
o explicit invocation of the reasoning process possible;
o reasoning engine can be used as a module in Tcl programs;
